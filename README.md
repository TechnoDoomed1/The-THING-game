# The THING game
A single player terminal based game I created back in its day, based on "The Thing" movie saga. Released on both English and Spanish, though the Spanish version is slightly newer and has a few extra bells and whistles added to it. The game is programmed with Python.

**DISCLAIMER:** I do not own anything related to "The Thing" (TM), and this game is something I did for fun, and in no way I intend to infringe on the copyright of this amazing franchise.

### How it works

You form part of a group of 20 scientists with some starting as monsters called THINGS. This means anyone can be a THING, even you. Each turn, some stay at the base and others decide to investigate outside. From the ones staying at the base, a sample of 8 people are tested each turn and if they are THINGS, they are discovered and killed (although this never worked in the movies, to be honest). Then, after the turn ends, up to 2 scientists from each group can be turned into a THING if there was any in it and wasn't killed in the testing phase. 

As the game progresses, you can take up to 2 shots at testing whoever you please, having to be extremely paranoid about people's intentions of staying or going outside, and considering who has the spottiest record. As if that wasn't enough, testing someone doesn't guarantee they'll remain human during the next turn, since conversion happens afterwards.

You can either become a THING too and try to survive to turn everyone and finally break free, dooming humanity... or viceversa, by containing the outbreak and killing everyone who was turned to preserve the future of humankind.
